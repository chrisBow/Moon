In his column for Marketing Week, Mark Ritson laid down a challenge to marketers regarding the UK’s EU membership referendum :

Did the illegal 6.4% overspend enable Vote Leave to win the day?
Was the additional spend of £449k (and change) critical in convincing enough people to vote leave and pave the way for Brexit? According to the article, marketers are the only people who can work this out.

I don’t agree with this and, while Mark Ritson qualifies it by saying “a particular marketer with advanced analytics training and nothing better to do for the next few days”, I still think there might be other particular people in other fields who would have as much chance of being able to prove it as a particular marketer. Assuming, that is, that they too had nothing better to do for the next few days.

However, this isn’t about the skills and abilities of marketers against other professions, this is about the working it out part. Personally, I just don’t think that’s something that can be done, and we might just have to accept that we’ll never know the answer. However, just thinking about this challenge can be a useful intellectual exercise in marketing analytics.
